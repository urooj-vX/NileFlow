### 🔁 NileFlow – Flow Into Smarter Trades
Build-Ready Bot – Clone & Customize

NileFlow is a clean, modular, and LLM-powered trading bot built with 🐍 Python and flexibility at its core. Whether you're automating your trading strategy or exploring AI-assisted decision-making, NileFlow gives you the tools — and the freedom — to do it your way.

⚡ Why NileFlow?
Trading automation tools often lock you into paid APIs or specific brokers.
NileFlow does the opposite. It’s free, transparent, and broker-agnostic.

You choose the broker API. You define the strategy. NileFlow is here to execute — using the MCP server and LLMs to bridge commands and decisions like never before.

No SDK lock-ins. No subscription traps. No black-box logic.
Just clean, Pythonic control over your trades — with smart extensions built in.

🔑 What Makes It Unique?
🧠 LLM-Driven Decision Making: Leverage modern AI (Claude or any LLM) to parse, evaluate, or react to signals.

🔗 MCP Server Backbone: Light protocol layer for clean communication between logic and execution.

🔌 Broker-Agnostic Design: Integrate any API, from Alpaca to Zerodha — the choice is yours.

⚙️ Modular, Beginner-Friendly Architecture: Swap out components without breaking the flow.

🧱 Build-First Philosophy: This isn't a drag-n-drop tool — it's your own customizable trading engine.

🛠️ Built With
Python3

MCP Server (custom protocol handler)

Claude or any other LLM (for strategy parsing & natural-language integration)

🙌 A Word From the Creator
“NileFlow is my way of rethinking trading automation — not as a black-box service, but as an open, intelligent system that developers can trust and extend.
I built it for myself, but it’s yours to shape now.” — Urooj
