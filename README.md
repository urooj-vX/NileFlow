# 🔁 NileFlow – Flow Into Smarter Trades  
**Build-Ready Bot ➡️ NileFlow – Clone & Customize**

**NileFlow** is a clean, modular, and LLM-powered trading bot built with 🐍 Python and flexibility at its core. Whether you're automating your trading strategy or exploring AI-assisted decision-making, NileFlow gives you the tools — and the freedom — to do it your way.

## ⚡ Why NileFlow?

Trading automation tools often lock you into paid APIs or specific brokers.  
**NileFlow** does the opposite. It’s **free**, **transparent**, and **broker-agnostic**.

You choose the broker API. You define the strategy. NileFlow is here to execute — using the **MCP server** and **LLMs** to bridge commands and decisions like never before.

> No SDK lock-ins. No subscription traps. No black-box logic.  
> Just clean, Pythonic control over your trades — with smart extensions built in.

## 🔑 What Makes It Unique?

- 🧠 **LLM-Driven Decision Making**: Leverage modern AI (Claude or any LLM) to parse, evaluate, or react to signals.
- 🔗 **MCP Server Backbone**: Light protocol layer for clean communication between logic and execution.
- 🔌 **Broker-Agnostic Design**: Integrate *any* broker API — from Alpaca to Zerodha — the choice is yours.
- ⚙️ **Modular, Beginner-Friendly Architecture**: Swap out components without breaking the flow.
- 🧱 **Build-First Philosophy**: This isn't a drag-and-drop tool — it's your own customizable trading engine.
